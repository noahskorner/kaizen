# Principles Every Software Engineer Should Follow

## Embrace Simplicity and Readability

- Simplify the business logic first, then the software. This ensures clarity and efficiency.
- We spend most of our time reading code. Make it easy to read. Prioritize clean, understandable code.
- Diagram it first. Visualize to clarify and communicate complex ideas.

## Feature and Component Design

- A feature is also a function. It should have inputs and consistent outputs. Ensure predictable behavior.
- Components should not have any business logic whatsoever in them. Maintain clear separation of concerns.
- Files and components are free. Use them! Modularize for better organization and reuse.

## Proactive Problem Solving and Initiative

- If you see a problem, fix it. Initiative is the most important trait of a software engineer. Be proactive and take ownership.
- "Do it now" should be an axiom. Avoid procrastination and address issues promptly.
- Having a 'wrong' idea is better than having no idea. Encourage creativity and risk-taking.

## Continuous Improvement and Feedback

- Working code is better than theoretical code. Working code is the first step, refactoring is the next step. Iterate and improve.
- Rapid feedback loops are crucial. Ensure quick testing, PR checks, and deployments for continuous improvement.
- Refinement is the most important Scrum meeting, and the easiest to neglect. Prioritize and maintain regular refinement sessions.

## Maintainability and Long-term Health

- Maintainability is the only indicator of software health. Prioritize code that is easy to maintain and evolve.
- Removing 'magic' (blackbox code) is important. Build or understand whatâ€™s inside the blackbox.
- Design changes need a goal and user feedback to back them up. Ensure changes add real value.

## Efficiency and Pragmatism

- Delay decisions as long as possible. Make informed choices with the most current information.
- What's the smallest thing we could do that would add value? Focus on delivering incremental value.
- Code should start specific and become generic. Integration tests start generic and become specific. Adapt and refine as you go.

## Collaboration and Communication

- Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structures. Foster clear and effective communication.
- Align frequently. Regularly step back to ensure the team is aligned with the bigger picture.

## Developer Experience

- Developer experience is paramount. Ensure a smooth, efficient development process to keep developers motivated.
- How often you release is directly correlated to how quickly you can resolve issues. Frequent releases aid in quick issue resolution.
- Delete your local repo frequently to test setup ease. Ensure the setup process remains simple and quick.

## Ownership and Responsibility

- "I don't want to fix it because if I break it, it becomes mine" Take ownership and responsibility for all code.
- Track tech debt with an interest rate. Monitor and manage technical debt proactively.

## Vision and Adaptability

- An epic is something the C-suite cares about. Align your work with the company's strategic direction.
- We value simple, elegant solutions. Strive for elegance and simplicity in every solution.
